# Introduction
As a musician, I find the physics behind music and sound in general to be extremely fascinating. As I discovered the doppler effect, I was immediately intrigued by its potential effect on music, hence this report. 

# Aim
I will be analysing the effect of the doppler effect on a sound source undergoing circular motion. 

 

# Data
Figure \ref{2m} plots the data points I collected when the radius of the string was 2m.
