# Markdown Paper

[Github repository](https://github.com/nico-bachner/md-paper)

A CLI tool to write scientific papers in Markdown. Initially, it was designed to be an easily customisable all-in-one compiler from Markdown to PDF via LaTeX, but has become more opinionated over time.

Uses [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and [pdflatex](https://www.latex-project.org) under the hood.

*Only designed to work on macOS x86_64, but should also work on Linux with some minor tweaks.*

## Installation
### Installing
For those unfamiliar with the command line:
1.  Go to **Applications**
2.  Go to **Utilities** (inside Applications)
3.  Open **Terminal.app** (inside Utilities)
4.  Copy one of the below options and paste it into Terminal.

#### Installation methods
-   With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
    For the moment, the Homebrew release is inofficial. 
    It only works if you copy [brew/md-paper.rb](brew/md-paper.rb) into \
    `/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula/md-paper.rb` \
    However, you need only do this step once. It will remember even when reinstalling from scratch.
    
    When done, installing is simply a matter of typing the following:
    ``` sh
    $ brew install md-paper
    ```
    
-   With `curl`:
    ``` sh
    curl https://md-paper.now.sh/install.sh | sh
    ```
    
When installed, you can check which version you are on by typing:
``` sh
$ md-paper --version
```
Shorthand: `-v`

### Reinstalling
To reinstall the program, simply write the following in your terminal:
``` sh
$ md-paper reinstall
```
Shorthand: `r`

### Uninstalling
To uninstall the entire program, write the following:
``` sh
$ md-paper uninstall
```
Shorthand: `u`

## Writing 
1. Create a folder that will contain your project.
2. Create your Markdown (`.md`) document inside that folder.
3. Check out the [YAML Options](#YAML-Options) section of this README for formatting options.
4. Start writing

## PDF Generation
1.  Open a new terminal window.
2.  Create a folder for your project if you haven't already and navigate into your project folder
    ``` sh
    $ mkdir FOLDER_NAME
    $ cd FOLDER_NAME
    ```
    Don't forget to replace `FOLDER_NAME` with the actual name of your project folder ðŸ˜„
3.  Now you can generate your pdf:
    ``` sh
    $ md-paper
    ```

## Build Options
This is the base command for pdf generation:
``` sh
md-paper
```

This base command can be extended by adding one or more of the following arguments:
-   Basic logs: `--log`
-   Auxiliary files (basically logs for all little parts of your document, such as the table of contents and): `--aux

For example, the following would keep the latex code, as well as the logs generated; all that in addition to the pdf.
``` sh
$ md-paper --log
```

If you just want to generate a LaTeX file, for example when sending your paper off to a publication, you can use
``` sh
$ md-paper tex
```

If you have a custom LaTeX file, you can process that and get back a PDF by using
``` sh
$ md-paper pdf
```

## Formatting Options
There are quite a few options for customisation, so not all will be listed here.

### Basic structure
Customisation can be done in a YAML (**Y**AML **A**in't **M**arkup **L**anguage) header which is an extra section above the content of your document:
``` YAML
---
YAML HEADER # formatting
---

MARKDOWN # content
```
Here's the minimum needed for a pdf to be generated
``` YAML
---
document-type: TYPE
    
title: "TITLE"
author: "AUTHOR"
---
# Hello, World!
```

### Document types
-   For articles and short reports:
    ``` YAML
    document-type: article
    ```
-   For longer reports:
    ``` YAML
    document-type: report
    ```

### Title, Author, Date
These are essential parts of any standalone document:
``` YAML
title: "YOUR DOCUMENT TITLE"
author: "YOUR NAME"
date: \today  # or write out a specific date in parentheses
```

### Custom Margins
LaTeX defines margins that are quite generous by default. If you should want to customise the margins, you can override the default as follows:
``` YAML
margins: 
    top: 3cm
    bottom: 1in
    left: 20pt
    right: 3em
```
Adjust values as needed.

### Importing packages
For specialised functionality, external packages may need to be imported:
``` YAML
packages:
    - package1
    - package2
```

If your TeX distribution doesn't include the full CTAN archive, non-standard packages will have to be downloaded individually before building:
``` sh
$ md-paper install PACKAGE_NAME
```
Instead of `install`, you can also use the shorthand `i`.

## Further Customisation
For all those with basic TeX knowledge, it is really easy to customise the build output even further than just through the YAML header. All the YAML options are derived from the `template.tex` file, located wherever you installed **md-paper** to, so feel free to check that out for the full customisation options)

***WARNING:***
*All of your changes to `template.tex` will be erased once you update **md-paper**, so edit the file at your own risk.* (unless of course you save your file and replace the one installed on update)

This is handy for a quick fix though if you can't wait long enough for the problem to be fixed properly

## Errors
