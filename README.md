# Markdown to PDF

Personalised and simplified markdown to pdf (via LaTeX) converter based on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and [pdflatex](https://www.latex-project.org)

## How to use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Pandoc and a TeX distribution (only needs to have pdflatex).
3. Delete content from essay.md that you don't need
4. Start writing :smile:
5. To generate the pdf, go to your terminal and type `./build.zsh` (only works if you're already in the project directory)
