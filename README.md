# Markdown Paper
A CLI tool to write scientific papers in Markdown. Initially, it was designed to be an easily customisable all-in-one compiler from Markdown to PDF via LaTeX, but has become more opinionated over time.

Uses [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and [pdflatex](https://www.latex-project.org) under the hood.

*Only designed to work on macOS x86_64, but should also work on Linux with some minor tweaks.*

## Usage
Read the [documentation](docs/README.md) or the [web docs](https://md-paper.now.sh/docs)
