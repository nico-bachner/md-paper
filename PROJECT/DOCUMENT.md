# Introduction

## Reasons for choice
Road pricing is a personal interest of mine. Since I am an avid cyclist, I dislike overly congested streets. They pollute the air and waste many people's time. 

## Outline
- Reasons for road pricing
  - Traffic jams
  - Accidents
  - Pollution
  - Government income
- Probe elasticity of automobile usage in Luxembourg 
- Explore changes in behaviour as a result of road pricing 
  - Impact on traffic jams 
  - Impact on accidents 
  - Impact on pollution 
- Explore impact on individual social classes 
- Will a congestion charge increase social inequality?
- Complications and issues to be resolved 
  - Will delivery services be exempt from the tax? 
  - Compare to other cities 
  - Costs vs benefits 
  - What methods to use to enable and enforce charges? 
  - Political viability and public opinion 
  - Impact of the “frontaliers” 

## Hypothesis
- Introducing a road user charge will have an overall positive outcome due to it decreasing automobile use, thus decreasing negative factors such as pollution and time waste through traffic jams
